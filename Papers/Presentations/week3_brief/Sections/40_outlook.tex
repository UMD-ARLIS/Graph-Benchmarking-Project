    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Identify more known (and suspected) recordings with back-masking
    	\begin{itemize}
    		\item Especially those that are a stretch and whose authors deny any backmasking
        \end{itemize}
        \item Do more preliminary research before coding attempts.
        \item Challenge: Can we exploit reinforcement learning by generating our own back-masked training set, coupled with known back-masked recordings?
    \end{itemize}
