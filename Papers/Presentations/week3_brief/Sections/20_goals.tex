        \begin{itemize}
        	\item \textbf{Problem:} 
			\begin{itemize} 
				\item How do we deploy machine learning tools to automatically seek out and detect planted content in reverse audio recordings (i.e., back-masking) of popular music?
			\end{itemize}
			\item Product 1: An algorithm/tool to perpetually scan the internet for commercially released popular music offerings, and maintain a database of recordings that have / need to be scanned
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Tie into existing recording industry products if possible
			\end{itemize}
			\item Product 2: An NLP-type algorithm to seek out back-masked speech in audio recordings, perhaps taking specific advantage of contextual information to reduce noise
			\item Product 3: A report generator that ranks elements of the database according to their risk posture for planted content, and presents them in ranked order to be manually validated
		\end{itemize}
