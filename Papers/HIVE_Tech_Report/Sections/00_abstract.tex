    Many analytic problems faced by the Intelligence and Security community can be characterized as graph problems. 
    Real-world datasets are large, dynamic and processing them may be bound by time, SWaP or policy.
    Graph Hardware Accelerators are emerging to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of processing these large datasets within constraints. 
    Evaluating the utility of graph hardware accelerators to problems faced by the Intelligence and Security community is the contribution that the Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security Graph Hardware Acceleration Benchmark (AGHAB) aims to make. 
    It provides an experimental pipeline that abstracts the instrumentation, dataset selection and algorithm choice from the evaluators, who instead focus on providing their hardware and an experiment definition. 
    The initial release of the AGHAB provides the mechanism to generate performance baselines on CPU and GPU architectures, in serial and shared-memory parallel paradigms.
