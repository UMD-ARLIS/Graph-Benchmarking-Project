# summer2023
Repo for Summer 2023 Graph Benchmarking Project

## Battle Rhythm: 
TBC but plan on: 
- 2 x Weekly meeting with faculty mentor
- 1 x Daily standup with Kent
- Routine Comms through Slack in the [HIVE2023 Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/hive2023workspace/shared_invite/zt-1vleu4e07-xrSi57M7ZrCtWKc6VMnQbA)
- Formal Meetings through Teams

## Project Structure:

### Papers
 Contains all files relevant to papers, presentations etc. Primarily LaTeX. Included the bibliography file.

### Code
 Contains all code relevant to the solving the problem at hand. Primarily C, little bit of python. Possibly some assembly, depending how unlucky we get. 

### Data 
 Contains TRIVIAL code examples for testing code only. All large data files are stored externally. 


## Initial Setup

assuming you have git installed locally, you should be able to just clone the repo with something like

`git clone https://github.com/osullik/summer2023.git`

check that the .gitignore comes down with it. And you should be right to go.

## Writing

We'll cover in more detail when we get to it.

If you're new to LaTeX we can use Overleaf to get started (Link Here)

## Coding

We'll use git to our advantage, but will work through how we want to handle branching, merges etc and document here. 

We should aim for Test-Driven development. In general: 
- identify a problem
- write a test that fails that problem
- write code to solve the problem
- pass the test
- refactor the code to solve the general case. 

If not fully test-driven, we should at least produce a unit test for each function that we write. As we mature we can add regression testing, integration testing etc. 

## Data management 

We'll use Google Drive Initially, with a TO-DO of finding a better version control system for datasets. 

## Task Tracking

We'll use Jira at this link: [Jira Board](https://osullik.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/HIVE/boards/1)
