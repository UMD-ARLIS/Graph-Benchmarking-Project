//These are the instructions for how to download and sync the Git LFS (Large File Storage) on your local terminal and our git repository.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD GIT LFS:

  1. Download and install the Git command line extension. 
        a. (With HomeBrew installed, run this command): brew install git-lfs
        b. (With MacPorts installed, run this command): port install git-lfs

  2. Once downloaded and installed, set up Git LFS for your user account by running: git lfs install
      * You only need to run this once per user account.

  3. Specify which files should be managed by Git LFS: In your repository, identify the file types or individual files that you want Git LFS to handle. 
     By default, Git LFS tracks files with specific extensions, such as large media files (e.g., images, videos, etc.). You can also explicitly specify 
     files using patterns or individual file names.
        a. git lfs track "*.jpg"  # Track all JPEG image files
        b. git lfs track "*.mp4"  # Track all MP4 video files
        c. git lfs track "largefile.bin"  # Track a specific file named largefile.bin

  4. Now make sure .gitattributes is tracked, Commit and push the changes: After specifying the file types or names to be managed by Git LFS, commit the changes and push them to the remote repository:
        a. git add .gitattributes
        b. git commit -m "Configure Git LFS"
        c. git push origin <branch-name>
     * Replace <branch-name> with the name of the branch you want to push to.

  6. Push large files using Git LFS: Now, whenever you want to push large files to the repository, use Git LFS. Instead of using the regular git add command, 
     you'll use git lfs track to add and track large files. For example:
        a. git lfs track "*.mov"  # Track all MOV video files
        b. git lfs track "*.psd"  # Track all PSD files
        c. git lfs track "bigfile.bin"  # Track a specific file named bigfile.bin
        
        a. git add .
        b. git commit -m "Add large files"
        c. git push origin <branch-name>
      * Make sure to specify the file types or names you want to track with Git LFS before adding and committing them.


That's it! Our Git repository will now use Git LFS to handle large files. When cloning or pulling the repository on another machine, ensure that Git LFS is installed, 
and the large files will be automatically downloaded and synced.
