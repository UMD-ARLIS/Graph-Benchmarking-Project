# Running the Scripts
If you are running this on your local computer make sure to change into the Data_Analysis directory of this github before running the command below

## Running Louvain GPU Implementation
To run on a test graph it must be a graph uploaded to the gunrock directory in .mtx format

```
python output_to_json_script.py <algo> <filename.mtx> <exec-type> --ssh-key-path /path/to/your/key.pem --ec2-instance-ip 54.84.25.80 --ec2-instance-username ubuntu
```
example:
```
python output_to_json_script.py louvain chesapeake.mtx parallel --ssh-key-path /Users/nani/Desktop/mnKeyPair.pem --ec2-instance-ip 54.84.25.80 --ec2-instance-username ubuntu

```
Future Plans/Fixes:
* Currently the full output prints to shell. I want to change this to extract and store only the necessary metric information (time, memory) (Addressed - extracts time metrics)
* I want to redirect output to LaTex/ReadTheDocs instead (Addressed - outputs to JSON)
* I want to parameterize further to incorporate input of any graph file from the local computer instead of simply allowing graphs will already exist in the server to be tested
* I want to integrate/explore more profiling tools to extract all info possible
* I want to integrate a graph viz feature to give a visual representation of the nodes/edges of an input graph. This will be integrated into the Latex/ReadTheDocs output solution

## Running SGM GPU Implementation (NEEDS TO BE UPDATED)

```
python3 gpu_script.py sm tri_sm.mtx sequential
```

## Running Louvain CPU Sequential Implementation (NEEDS TO BE UPDATED)

* Must be a graph uploaded to directory in .txt format

```
python3 cpu_louvain_script.py <filename>
```
example:
```
python3 cpu_louvain_script.py chesapeake
```
