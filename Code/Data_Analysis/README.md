# Running the Scripts
Download the code and make necessary changes to file paths whenever it says "############# CHANGEME #############"

# Running any GPU Implementation
* Must be a graph uploaded to directory in .mtx format

```
python3 gpu_script.py <algo> <filename.mtx> <exec-type>
```
example:
```
python3 gpu_script.py louvain chesapeake.mtx parallel
```
OR
```
python3 gpu_script.py sm tri_sm.mtx sequential
```

# Running Louvain CPU Sequential Implementation

* Must be a graph uploaded to directory in .txt format

```
python3 cpu_louvain_script.py <filename>
```
example:
```
python3 cpu_louvain_script.py chesapeake
```
