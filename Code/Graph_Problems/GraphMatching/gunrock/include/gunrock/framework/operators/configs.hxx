/**
 * @brief Load balancing techniques options (for now, solely for advance).
 *
 * @par Overview
 * The following enum defines load-balancing techniques supported (or to be
 * supported) within gunrock. Right now these techniques are only valid for
 * advance, but we envision future operators can also benefit from them. This
 * enum can be passed into advance template parameter list to select the
 * respective underlying load-balanced advance kernel to use. The following
 * table attempts to summarize these techniques:

 * |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
 * | Summary | 1 element per thread | Block-sized elements per block |
 * Warp-sized elements per warp | Buckets per threads, warps, blocks | Equal
 * non-zeros per thread | Equal work-item (input and output) per thread | Steal
 * work from threads when starving | | Number of Scans | 1 | 2 | 2 | Unknown |
