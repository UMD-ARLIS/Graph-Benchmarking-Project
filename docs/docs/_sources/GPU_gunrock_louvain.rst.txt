**Gunrock** is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the GPU. It uses a **high-level**, **bulk-synchronous**, **data-centric abstraction** focused on operations on vertex or edge frontiers. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies, particularly in the area of fine-grained load balancing, with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives that scale from one to many GPUs on a node with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge. For more details, see `Gunrock's Overview <https://gunrock.github.io/docs/#/gunrock/overview>`_.

Quick Start Guide
-----------------

Before building Gunrock make sure you have **CUDA Toolkit 10.2 or higher** installed on your Linux system. We also support building Gunrock on docker images using the provided docker files under `docker` subdirectory. For complete build guide, see `Building Gunrock <https://gunrock.github.io/docs/#/gunrock/building_gunrock>`_.

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/
   cd gunrock
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)
   make test
