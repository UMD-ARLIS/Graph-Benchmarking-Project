Running Tests
-------------

To run the tests, use the makefile created by Kent:

.. code-block:: shell

    make all

Then the two test options are for a verbose and minimal report, respectively:

.. code-block:: shell

    ./test.o
    ./testsuite.o

To remove the binaries, use:

.. code-block:: shell

    make clean
